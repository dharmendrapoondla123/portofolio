        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Dharmendra Poondla, a passionate and driven developer currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer
            Science and Engineering at Saveetha School of Engineering, with an expected graduation in 2025. I have a
            strong foundation in programming languages like Python, Java, and JavaScript, and I'm eager to apply my
            skills in a challenging developer role.</p>
        <p>My academic journey includes a Diploma in Mechanical Engineering, which has provided me with valuable
            insights into industrial processes and quality assurance, as demonstrated by my internship at Nelcast. I'm
            particularly interested in leveraging data analysis and machine learning to build innovative solutions, as
            showcased by my House Price Prediction Model project.</p>
        <p>I'm a quick learner, dedicated to continuous improvement, and I'm looking forward to contributing my skills
            to a dynamic and forward-thinking organization.</p>

            <h3>House Price Prediction Model</h3>
            <p>This project aims to analyze how different features impact house prices. By examining data on various
                house characteristics (location, size, bedrooms, bathrooms, age), we can identify key factors affecting
                prices. The steps include data collection, analysis using statistical and machine learning techniques,
                and building predictive models. The goal is to provide insights for homeowners, buyers, and real estate
                professionals. For example, we might find that houses in specific neighbourhoods or with more bedrooms
                sell for higher prices, helping stakeholders make better decisions in the real estate market. (Nov’23 –
